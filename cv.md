## About me
   Hi, I'm Roman, an ordinary 3rd year student of the Samara College of Communications. I have been studying Front-end for several years on my own using YouTube videos or free courses. I have no commercial development experience, **but I really want to become a professional web developer**. This is my first time at RS School and I hope that here I will be able to develop my team skills and direct knowledge of JS and Git. _I desperately want to achieve results and get a job, for this I have removed from my life all the factors that can hinder me, and nothing prevents me from going to the goal no matter what!_

## Education

  * **Secondary School No. 48 ( 2011 - 2020 )** - This stage of my life was not easy for me, there were many difficulties, but I coped with it and graduated from school with grades 4-5
  * **College of Communication (2020 - 2022)** - Now I am studying at this college and everything suits me. The only program that was designed for the 3rd and 4th year was completed by me this summer and I realized that I would not learn anything new there and that's why I'm here!
